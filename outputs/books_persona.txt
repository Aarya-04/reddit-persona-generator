🔗 EVIDENCE & CITATIONS
- "The "patents or secrecy?" choice suggest a simple test for patentability:
If you could not get a patent for some technology would you keep it secret? Is there anything to keep secret anyway?
I think that in the software patents case the answer is definitely no.
Lets look at the one-click patent. Suppose the patent office had not granted Amazon a patent.
What could Amazon keep secret? The implementation is irrelevant. The one-click patent could be implemented in any number of algorithms, in any number of programming languages - or even in hardware. The mere fact that Amozon lets you order stuff by clicking just once, is not a secret, Amazon is very proud of it as a matter of fact. So in the one-click case there is nothing to keep secret. I think this holds true for most other software patent as well." — classified as technology
