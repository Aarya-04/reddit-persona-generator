🔗 EVIDENCE & CITATIONS
- "All good things must come to an end, and here we are again, at the end of my cake day. I still really enjoy this silly little yearly tradition despite this being the last time, and I’m looking forward to next year already. Thanks for making today freakin’ sweet! See you all in 2026!" — classified as funny
- "Over 2 months ago, I posted an announcement to my profile claiming that I was leaving reddit due to being banned from the main subs that I commented on at the time. However, I ultimately decided against it due to the realization that there were other subs that I could comment on.

&#x200B;

However, that is no longer the case. I'm banned from more subs than I can count, and am currently only able to comment on about 2 or 3 subs with a decent member size.

&#x200B;

I've also almost completely lost interest, and have become bored of explaining jokes due to doing the same thing over and over every day for 2 months.

&#x200B;

I'll be on my discord server, if you want to talk to me: [https://discord.gg/TJzbcfE](https://discord.gg/TJzbcfE)

&#x200B;

It's been a wild ride. Thank you and goodbye, everyone." — classified as personal story

- "I meant to say “sixth time” instead of “last time” don’t shit your britches I can’t edit the title now, not stopping this yet.

I’d normally do my YouTube plug here, but I’ve more or less moved on from that, so it’s probably not worth it. My [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/unfunny) is still somewhat active, however, so feel free to join and see me when I make my biweekly appearance. Peter out!" — classified as advice
- "Hey guys, Peter Griffin here to explain the joke one last time before I depart once again. Basically, these parts of the towels seem to serve a few purposes. As well as just looking nice, they prevent fraying on the ends of the towel, and soak up moisture at a concentrated point. Peter out for the final time in 2025! Thanks for having me, I’ll see all you legends again next year!" — classified as funny
- "Hey guys, Peter Griffin here to explain the joke, returning for my wholesome 100 cake day. So basically, when you’re trying to sleep, your brain will often put thoughts like this into your head that you can’t get out, and need to find the answer to before going to sleep. Peter out!" — classified as funny
- "Hey guys, Peter Griffin here to explain the joke, returning for my wholesome 100 cake day. So basically, a bundle of sticks has two meanings in this context. One alternative name for it is the f slur, and another is “fascis” in Latin, which sounds similar to fascist and is the reason the guy got punched. Peter out!" — classified as funny
- "Hey guys, Peter Griffin here to explain the joke, returning for my wholesome 100 cake day. So basically, the top image is a dill, a type of herb, and the bottom image is a doe, a deer, a female deer. Put the two together and you get dilldoe, which sounds like dildo. Peter out!" — classified as funny
