- "Born and raised in Delhi - I shifted to LKO in Dec 24 for business purposes. I have hardly seen a car which does not have a sticker on it - everyone is uttar pradesh sarkar, adhiwakta, nyay palika, mahamantri, skoda laura, adrak lsson. 


What is the obsession peeps." — classified as career
- "Scam." — classified as funny
- "Malls are a thing of past - and entire LKO is on steroids in rents cost, despite low to no demand." — classified as funny
- "I was caught without helmet and license (close to my home). Cops outright wanted to fine me, but a 'common guy' came in and discussed bribe on my behalf with cops. I gave him 200rs (back in 2011) and Cops let me go.

He was not a common man. He was their agent and shield. If I or anyone recorded myself handing out money, it would be to a common man, not cops directly." — classified as personal story
- "Cops keep a civ around to discuss bribes." — classified as funny
- "Toh hum Noida or Ghaziabad se pahadio ko bhagana shuru karein fir? 😂 Bhukmari ajaegi" — classified as funny
