🔗 EVIDENCE & CITATIONS

- "So earlier this week, I noticed my Xbox app no longer allows me to use it to stream from my Xbox. It essentially forces me to stream from the Xbox website.

The quality went from near perfect and incredibly good to complete garbage; slow, pixelated, and virtually unusable. Why was this decision made and is there any way to revert back to using the app as it was before? It’s really disappointing to not be able to stream via app and like I said, the web streaming is simply not useable.

Anyone out there think we can convince devs to rethink their decision?!

(Admittedly I tried posting this on /r/Xbox but one of the mods considered this an Xbox support issue. I think it’s a community and dev issue personally. )" — classified as personal story

- "I have owned numerous luxury brands, including Audi, BMW, Mercedes… about five years ago I swore I would be driving a future Tesla model once the mileage and battery issues got sorted out. 

Now, Elon completely destroyed the company brand in my view. I wouldn’t be caught dead driving a Tesla, and certainly not owning one. So, I’m curious... am I in good company, or, am I in the minority here? If you’re politically in line, will you be buying electric? Specifically, Tesla?" — classified as technology
- "Hey all, looking for a uworld discount. 

Can anyone help? Thanks in advance!" — classified as technology
- "Fair enough" — classified as self-help
- "He is a pedophile; we’ve all always known it… maga nuts just refused to admit it because obtaining power was so much more important than him diddling kids for sport." — classified as career
- "More evidence of the complete piece of shit and poor excuse of a human being he is." — classified as personal story
- "He is looking off in the distance, almost as though he is looking for something … or someone.

That entire situation is damning proof that either God doesn’t exist or doesn’t care about humankind." — classified as gaming
- "Yeah, okay. Fair enough, I see a lot of apologizing for bad behavior and get a bit frustrated. I think if anyone is trying to make it harder to be transparent and find justice.. they suck.. left right or indifferent." — classified as advice
